## Fundamentals of Reinforcement Learning 

### Elements of RL

* A **policy** is a mapping of the actions of an agent give an perceived state of the environment.

* A **reward signal** defines the goal of the agent and is the primary way the *policy* is updated.

* The **value function** is specifies how good a state is with regard to the long-term reward the agent expect to obtain when starting from that state  <!-- TODO: This definition needs refining -->

* Some RL systems involve a **model**, which mimic the environment and allow the agent to make inferences about how the environment will change during interactions.
